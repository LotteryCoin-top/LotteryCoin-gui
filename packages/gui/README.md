Lottery GUI - written in TypeScript and uses Electron/React.

## Development

Please read and follow the main [README.md](https://github.com/LotteryCoin-top/LotteryCoin-gui) of this monorepo.

## Best practices

- Only one exported component per file
- Same file name like exported function / component / class
- CSS, GraphQL file next to the component file with different extension
- For material-ui use the sx property or other properties instead of styled
